##Binary Search Algorithm Explained üîç
#What is Binary Search?
Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item in a sorted list. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, dramatically reducing the number of comparisons needed compared to a linear search.

#How It Works (Simple Explanation)
Imagine you're looking for a word in a dictionary:

Open to the middle - Check the word in the middle

Compare - Is your word before or after this word?

Eliminate half - Discard the half that can't contain your word

Repeat - Continue with the remaining half until found

#Time Complexity
Best case: O(1) - Item is in the middle

Average case: O(log n) - Extremely efficient

Worst case: O(log n) - Still very efficient
