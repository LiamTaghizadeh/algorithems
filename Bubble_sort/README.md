# Bubble Sort Algorithm in Python

## ðŸ§¼ What is Bubble Sort?

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

## ðŸŽ¯ Algorithm Explanation

Imagine bubbles rising to the surface - larger elements "bubble up" to the end of the list with each pass.

**How it works:**
1. Start from the beginning of the list
2. Compare each pair of adjacent elements
3. If they're in the wrong order, swap them
4. Repeat until no more swaps are needed

**Time Complexity:**
- Worst-case: O(nÂ²) - Very slow for large lists
- Best-case: O(n) - When list is already sorted
- Average-case: O(nÂ²)


## ðŸ“Š Performance Analysis

The repository includes comprehensive performance analysis:

1. **Time complexity verification** with different input sizes
2. **Comparison with other sorting algorithms** (QuickSort, MergeSort)
3. **Best-case vs worst-case performance** analysis
4. **Memory usage profiling**


## ðŸŽ¨ Visualization

The project includes a visualization module that shows:
- Step-by-step sorting process
- Color-coded element comparisons and swaps
- Real-time performance metrics
- Animated sorting visualization
